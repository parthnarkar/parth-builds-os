## Overview

This repository serves as a living document of my journey as a developer, capturing every step of growth from localhost episodes to production deployments. Whether you're a beginner looking for structured learning paths or an experienced developer wanting to contribute, this repository is designed to be your companion in the coding journey.

**What makes this different?** This isn't just a collection of code snippets. It's a thoughtfully organized knowledge base with detailed explanations, real-world problem-solving approaches and progressive learning paths that anyone can follow or contribute to.

## What's Inside

### Data Structures & Algorithms

Comprehensive problem sets organized by topic, with detailed explanations and multiple solution approaches. Each problem includes:

- Problem statement and constraints
- Intuitive explanations of the approach
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Working code implementations
- Edge cases and test scenarios

**Current Topics:**
- **[Arrays](./DSA/Arrays)** - Foundational array manipulation and algorithms
- **[Linked Lists](./DSA/Linked%20List)** - Complete guide with 3 progressive problem sets

### Web Development

Full-stack development resources covering the MERN stack and modern web technologies.

**Coming Soon:**
- React fundamentals and advanced patterns
- JavaScript deep dives
- Backend development with Node.js
- Database design and optimization
- Project-based learning modules

### Daily Logs & Notes

Real-time documentation of learning experiences, challenges faced and solutions discovered.

## Getting Started

### For Learners

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/parthnarkar/parth-builds-os.git
   cd parth-builds-os
   ```

2. **Navigate to your topic of interest**
   - Start with DSA fundamentals in the [Arrays](./DSA/Arrays) section
   - Progress through [Linked Lists](./DSA/Linked%20List) with structured problem sets
